Web Authencation API (WebAuthn) is state-of-the art techology that is expected to replace passwords.

![Andriod Fingerprint](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1FWkRE8D7NTA2Kn1DrPjPA.png)

For FIDO2, the following are supported
 * **security keys** (Firefox 60+, Chrome 67+, Edge 18+, Safari 13 on Mac OS, Chrome on Andriod, Safari on iOS 13.3+),
 * **Windows Hello** (Firefox 67+, Chrome 72+ , Edge),
 * **Apple's Touch ID/Face ID** (Chrome 70+ on Mac OS X, Safari on macOS Big Sur, Safari on iOS 14.0+ ),
 * **android-safetynet** (Chrome 70+, Firefox 68+)
 * **NFC devices using PCSC** (Not Tested, but as supported in fido2)
 * **Soft Tokens** 
    * ~~[krypt.co](https://krypt.co/): Login by a notification on your phone.~~

**Update**: Dec 2022, krypt.co has been killed by Google for Passkeys.

In English :), It allows you to verify the user by security keys on PC, Laptops or Mobiles, Windows Hello (Fingerprint, PIN) on Windows 10 Build 1903+ (May 2019 Update) Touch/Face ID on Macbooks (Chrome, Safari), Touch/Face ID on iPhone and iPad and Fingerprint/Face/Iris/PIN on Android Phones.

Trusted device is a mode for the user to add a device that doesn't support security keys like Android without fingerprints or NFC.

**Note**: `U2F and FIDO2 can only be served under secure context (https)`

Package tested with Django 1.8, Django 2.2 on Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+ but it was not checked with any version in between but open for issues.

If you just need WebAuthn and Passkeys, you can use **[django-passkeys](https://github.com/mkalioby/django-passkeys)**, which is a slim-down of this app and much easier to integrate.

4. Break your login function

   Usually your login function will check for username and password, log the user in if the username and password are correct and create the user session, to support mfa, this has to change
   
      * authenticate the user
      * if username and password are correct , check if the user has mfa or not
          * if user has mfa then redirect to mfa page
          * if user doesn't have mfa then call your function to create the user session

   ```python
    def login(request): # this function handles the login form POST
       user = auth.authenticate(username=username, password=password)  
       if user is not None: # if the user object exist
            from mfa.helpers import has_mfa
            res =  has_mfa(username = username,request=request) # has_mfa returns false or HttpResponseRedirect
            if res:
                return res
            return log_user_in(request,username=user.username) 
            #log_user_in is a function that handles creatung user session, it should be in the setting file as MFA_CALLBACK
     ```
5. Add mfa to urls.py
   ```python 
   import mfa
   import mfa.TrustedDevice
   urls_patterns= [
   '...',
   url(r'^mfa/', include('mfa.urls')),
   url(r'devices/add$', mfa.TrustedDevice.add,name="mfa_add_new_trusted_device"), # This short link to add new trusted device
   '....',
    ]
    ```
6. Provide `mfa_auth_base.html` in your templates with block called 'head' and 'content', The template will be included during the user login, the template shall be close to the login template.
    If you will use Email Token method, then you have to provide template named `mfa_email_token_template.html` that will content the format of the email with parameter named `user` and `otp`.
7. To match the look and feel of your project, MFA includes `base.html` but it needs blocks named `head` & `content` to added its content to it.
   **Note:** Starting v2.3.0, a new template `mfa_base.html` is introduced, this template is used by `MFA.html` so you can control the styling better and current `mfa_base.html` extends `base.html`
8. Somewhere in your app, add a link to 'mfa_home'
```<li><a href="{% url 'mfa_home' %}">Security</a> </li>```


For Example, See 'example' app and look at EXAMPLE.md to see how to set it up.

# Going Passwordless

To be able to go passwordless for returning users, create a cookie  named 'base_username' containing username as shown in snippet below
```python
    response = render(request, 'Dashboard.html', context))
    if request.session.get("mfa",{}).get("verified",False)  and getattr(settings,"MFA_QUICKLOGIN",False):
        if request.session["mfa"]["method"]!="Trusted Device":
            response.set_cookie("base_username", request.user.username, path="/",max_age = 15*24*60*60)
    return response
```

Second, update the GET part of your login view
```python
    if "mfa" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS and getattr(settings,"MFA_QUICKLOGIN",False) and request.COOKIES.get('base_username'):
        username=request.COOKIES.get('base_username')
        from mfa.helpers import has_mfa
        res =  has_mfa(username = username,request=request,)
        if res: return res
        ## continue and return the form.
```
# Checking MFA on Client Side

Sometimes you like to verify that the user is still there so simple you can ask django-mfa2 to check that for you

```html
    {% include 'mfa_check.html' %}
```
````js
function success_func() {
  //logic if mfa check succeeds
}
function fail_func() {
  //logic if mfa check fails
}
function some_func() {
    recheck_mfa(success_func,fail_func,MUST_BE_MFA)
    //MUST_BE_MFA true or false, if the user must has with MFA
  }
